Question: Explain Finally and Final Keyword with an Example?
Answer:
	"finally" block is a keyword used along with try-catch block to make sure that the
	program inside the finally block will irrespective of whether the exception was handled
	or not.
	
	For e.g. -->
	      public class Main{
	          public static int hey(int num) throws ArithmeticException{
	              if(num > 10){
	                  return num % 2;
	              }
	              else{
	                 throw new ArithmeticException();
	              }
	          }
	      
	          public static void main(String[] args){
	             try{
	                int x = 20;
	                int y = hey(x);
	                System.out.println("reached the end of try block. The value of y is " + y);
	             }
	             catch(Exception e){
	                System.out.println("reached catch block due to exception");
	             }
	             finally{
	                System.out.prinln("reached finally block");
	             }
	          }
	      }
	      
	      In this example if I will pass input more than 10 the output will be:-
	      
	      reached the end of try block, The value of y is 0.
	      reacehd finally block.
	      
	      but if I will pass value less than or equals to 10 the output will be:-
	      
	      reached catch block due to exception
	      reached finally block
	      
	      In both cases finally block executed irrespective of whether it threw an exception or not.
	
	
	
	
	"final" keyword is used to declare that value of the variable or method cannot be overriden.
	For example -->
	      public class Main{
	          
	          public static void main(String[] args){
	              NewObj newObj = new NewObj();
	              newObj.a = 20;
	              System.out.println(10);
	          }
	      }
	      
	      class NewObj{
	         final public int a = 10;
	      }
	      
	      This program will throw a compile time error because we are trying to change a
	      varibale with final keyword as signature.
