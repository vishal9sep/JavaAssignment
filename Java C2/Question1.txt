Is-A Relationship

An IS-A relationship is inheritance,the classes which inherit are known as sub classes or child
classes.In this we can say that child class is a type of parent class.
for eg-an apple is a fruit,so you will extend fruit to get apple

class Apple extends Fruit{
	}
It is a static(compile time)binding

Has-A Relationship

An Has-A Relationship is composition means creating instances which have references to other objects.
for eg- a room has a table,so you will create a class room and then in that class create an instance of
type table.

class Room{
 Table table=new Table();
 }
It is dynamic(runtime binding)


Access modifiers and their accessibility
Their are types of java access modifiers:
1. Private-The access level of private modifier is only within the class.
It can't be accessed from outside the class

2. Default-The access level of a default modifier is only within the package.
It can't be accessed from outside the package.If you donot specify any access level,it will be the default.

3. Protected- the access level of protected modifier is within the package and outside the package
through child class.If you don't make the child class,it can't be accessed from outside the package

4. Public-the access level of a public modifier is everywhere.It can be accessed 
within the class,outside the class,within the package and outside the package.
